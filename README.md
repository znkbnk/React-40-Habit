Step 1: Modify HabitForm.js Component

In the HabitForm component, ensure you have a state variable to store the selected date. 
Next, in the handleFormSubmit function, you'll need to update the habit object to include the selected date when a specific date is chosen from the calendar. You can do this using a conditional check. If selectedFrequency is not "none," include the selected date.
Make sure that the Calendar component in your HabitForm component is correctly using the selectedDate for its value and setting the selected date using the onChange handler.

Step 2: Modify HabitList Component

In the HabitList component, you can display the selected date along with the habit details. You can add a condition to check if the selectedDate property is available in the habit object and display it.
